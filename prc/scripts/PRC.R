# 21.9% explained by time



# The first RDA axis has an eigenvalue of 25.3.

#If we divide this
# eigenvalue by the sum of all eigenvalues, we get the proportion
# of explained variance which is displayed on the first axis1:

## Significance tests
# Observations from a experimental ditch are not
# independent, since the same ditch was measured repeatedly during
# the experiment. We have to take this into account:
#   each ditch represents a time-series.
# We will permute the whole series of one ditch, keeping the temporal order.
# To setup such a permutation scheme we use the permute package,
# which is automatically loaded with vegan :
control <- how(plots = Plots(strata = ditch, type = "free"),
                within = Within(type = "none"), nperm = 99)
# This sets up our permutation scheme:
# plots   : We will permute ditches, without any restrictions.
# within  : But within one ditch there will be no permutations.
# nperm   : We request 99 permutations.

# Permutation tests using this scheme can be performed using anova:
set.seed(1234)
# Test of first eigenvalue
anova(mod_prc, permutations = control, first = TRUE)
# same as testing significance of axes
# but this take smuch longer, as all axes are tested
# anova(mod_prc, permutations = control, by = "axis")

# Test of terms
anova(mod_prc, permutations = control, by = "terms")

# Overall test
anova(mod_prc, permutations = control)

# NOEC
# Besides the overall significance of treatment, we can also look which treatments
# differ from control in order to get a no-observed-effect Concentration (NOEC) [=the concentration below the lowest significant concentration].
# Testing by permutations fails here, because there are not enough unique permutations
# (we have only 2 treated and 4 controls per sampling date). T

# One sultion is to break it down to a univariate problem.
# A PCA is performed and scores on first axis are compared using univariate techniques
# Therefore they applied a Williams Test [1] on the first principle component of a PCA on each sampling date.
