	abstract = {Effects of anthropogenic and environmental stressors on freshwater communities can propagate to ecosystem functions and may in turn impede ecosystem services. We investigated potential shifts in ecosystem functions that provide energy for freshwater ecosystems due to pesticides and salinity in 24 sites in streams of southeast Australia. First, effects on allochthonous organic matter ({AOM}) breakdown using three different substrates (leaves, cotton strips, wood sticks) in coarse and fine bags were investigated. Second, we examined effects on stream metabolism that delivers information on the ecosystem functions of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. We found up to a fourfold reduction in {AOM} breakdown due to exposure to pesticides and salinity, where both stressors contributed approximately equally to the reduction. The effect was additive as, no interaction or correlation between the two stressors was found. Leaf breakdown responded strongly and exclusively to exposure to pesticides and salinity, whereas cotton strip breakdown was less sensitive and responded also to other stressors such as nutrients. No functional redundancy for the effects of pesticides and salinity on leaf breakdown was observed. For wood stick breakdown, no relationship to environmental gradients was found, however, the sample size was lower. We did not detect effects of pesticides or salinity on gross primary production or ecosystem respiration. A reduction in {AOM} breakdown by pesticides and salinity may impair the ecosystem services of food provision and possibly water purification. Hence, future studies should examine the spatial extent of these effects.},

	title = {Is there an interaction of the effects of salinity and pesticides on the community structure of macroinvertebrates?},
	volume = {437},
	abstract = {Salinisation of freshwater ecosystems is a global problem affecting many regions worldwide and can co-occur with pesticides in agricultural regions. Given that both stressors are potent to affect macroinvertebrate communities, their effects could interact. We investigated the effects of salinity and pesticides at 24 sites in an agricultural region of southern Victoria, South-East Australia. We used distance-based redundancy analysis to determine the influence of pesticides, salinity and other environmental variables on the composition of macroinvertebrate communities. Salinity and pesticide toxicity had a statistically significant effect on communities as had the substrate composition and the percentage of pool and riffle sections in the sampled stream reaches. We did not find evidence for interactive effects between salinity and pesticides, i.e. the effect of one of these variables did not depend on the level of the other. Nevertheless, our results show that salinisation and exposure to pesticides can be major factors for the structure of macroinvertebrate communities in agricultural regions. Pesticide toxicity acted on a lower taxonomic level compared to salinity, potentially indicating evolutionary adaptation to salinity stress.},
